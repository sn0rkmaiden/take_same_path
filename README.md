# :luggage: Visualizer-app for different algorithms for solving Traveling Salesman Problem

This is my project for *Game Theory and Operations Research* course at university. *__The app currently works only on Android devices__*.

## :memo: About

App allows user to draw the path on canvas manually at the same time as built-in algorithms wokrs (sort of like in a competition) to compare performance of different approaches.

Supported algorithms:
1. Branch and bound
2. Generic algorithm

## :rocket: How to use?

You can buiid the app using source code in Android Studio or Visual Studio code.

## :mag: Demo
